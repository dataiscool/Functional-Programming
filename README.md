# Functional-Programming
This repository contains some projects relating to functional programming (OCaml).<rb>

Topics explored throughout the projects include binding and scoping, parameter passing, lambda abstraction, data abstraction, and type checking.<rb>
In the final project, I use OCaml to design and implement a functional programming language using the above concepts.
